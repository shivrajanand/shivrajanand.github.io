                        <p>This was the start of my interest in building a full fledged human like AI system. I know its
                            a bit childish but being an Iron Man fan I always wanted to build something like the JARVIS
                            AI. Inspired from that I started developing my own system which in turn made me want to
                            learn AIML in deep. This chatbot however just understands basic commands that are prefedded
                            to it and also can open some applications which I allow it to do. I got the 3rd rank
                            certificate for this project at the project presentation on the event of Engineer's day,
                            2022. <strong>I might have made the project private on github. You can <a

                                <p>The project is focused on analyzing a dataset to predict house sale prices based on
                                    different attributes, particularly using regression models and evaluating their
                                    effectiveness. The goal is to improve the prediction accuracy by employing different
                                    strategies, including using the mean sales price, leveraging house grades, and
                                    applying gradient descent for model optimization.</p>

                                <h2>Step-by-Step Description:</h2>
                                <h3>1. Data Loading & Initial Visualization:</h3>
                                <p>The dataset is first loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file. The dataset
                                    contains information about various houses, including their sale prices and other
                                    features.</p>
                                <p>A simple scatter plot is created comparing the actual sale price of the houses
                                    against the predicted price using a very basic model—the mean sale price across all
                                    houses.</p>

                                <h3>2. Predicting with Mean Sale Price:</h3>
                                <p>The mean of the sale prices is computed and used as the predicted sale price for all
                                    houses. This represents the simplest predictive model where every house's sale price
                                    is predicted to be the same as the overall mean sale price.</p>
                                <p>A scatter plot is used to show both the actual sale prices (in red) and the predicted
                                    mean prices (in green) for all houses.</p>

                                <h3>3. Improvement with House Grade:</h3>
                                <p>Instead of using a single mean value for all houses, the model is enhanced by
                                    calculating the mean sale price based on different house grades (e.g., quality of
                                    construction or features).</p>
                                <p>A pivot table is created to calculate the mean sale price for each grade of house,
                                    and this model is used to predict the sale price for each house. This approach
                                    improves accuracy by accounting for the differences between house grades.</p>
                                <p>The residual plot, which shows the difference between the actual and predicted
                                    prices, is evaluated for both models: the mean price model and the grade-based
                                    model. The grade-based model shows better alignment with the zero line, indicating
                                    better accuracy.</p>

                                <h3>4. Model Evaluation:</h3>
                                <p>The effectiveness of both models is assessed using error metrics such as Mean
                                    Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). These metrics are used to
                                    evaluate the models' performance and to identify which model provides a better fit
                                    to the data. The goal is to minimize these errors to achieve more accurate
                                    predictions.</p>

                                <h3>5. Regression with Flat Area (Square Footage):</h3>
                                <p>The next part of the project involves exploring the relationship between the flat
                                    area of a house and its sale price. The assumption is that a larger flat area
                                    corresponds to a higher sale price.</p>
                                <p>A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between flat area
                                    (independent variable) and sale price (dependent variable).</p>
                                <p>Initially, a basic regression model (mean regression) is applied, but it is
                                    recognized that the relationship between flat area and sale price is more complex
                                    and cannot be captured perfectly by a simple mean.</p>

                                <h3>6. Optimization with Gradient Descent:</h3>
                                <p>To improve the regression model, the project moves on to implement Gradient Descent,
                                    a machine learning optimization algorithm. Gradient Descent is used to find the
                                    optimal parameters (slope and intercept) for the regression line, thus improving the
                                    model's predictions.</p>
                                <p>The algorithm starts with initial guesses for the slope and intercept and iteratively
                                    updates these parameters in the direction that reduces the error (difference between
                                    predicted and actual prices).</p>
                                <p>The key to this method is that it automates the process of finding the best-fitting
                                    line without manually adjusting parameters. By minimizing the cost (error), the
                                    Gradient Descent method aims to achieve the most accurate prediction.</p>

                                        takes house grade into account significantly improved prediction accuracy. This
                                        demonstrates the importance of incorporating relevant features into predictive
                                        models.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Regression Analysis:</strong> The relationship between house flat area
                                        and sale price was explored using a basic regression model. While the model
                                        initially had some errors, it laid the foundation for applying more advanced
                                        optimization techniques.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gradient Descent:</strong> By using Gradient Descent, the project
                                        illustrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to optimize
                                        regression models and improve predictions. The iterative nature of Gradient
                                        Descent helps fine-tune the model’s parameters, leading to better results over
                                        time.</li>

                                <p>This project demonstrates the use of simple statistical models and machine learning
                                    techniques to predict house sale prices. It highlights the importance of considering
                                    multiple factors, such as house grade and flat area, and the effectiveness of
                                    optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent to improve model accuracy. The
                                    comparison of different methods and the evaluation using error metrics provide a
                                    comprehensive understanding of how to build and refine predictive models.</p>

                        <h3>Abstract</h3>
                        <p>This project involves analyzing students' academic progress by generating personalized
                            progress reports based on their marks and CGPA scores over multiple semesters. The data used
                            for this project is sourced from the 5th-semester results of my college. Using Python, the
                            dataset is cleaned and transformed for accurate data representation. The main objective is
                            to plot the CGPA scores for each student, visualize their academic performance over time,
                            and generate a progress report. The project utilizes the <strong><i>pandas</strong></i> library for
                            data manipulation and <strong><i>matplotlib</strong></i> for visualizing the student's progress. The
                            generated reports can be saved as images for easy access and review, helping students and
                            educators track academic growth and identify areas for improvement.</p>

                                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                                <p>This project involves analyzing student marks and generating a personalized progress
                                    report for each student. The dataset consists of CGPA scores, semester-wise marks,
                                    and other relevant academic information. Using Python libraries like
                                    <strong><i>pandas</strong></i> and <strong><i>matplotlib</strong></i>, the project reads data from a CSV
                                    file, processes it, and generates visual reports for students. The reports showcase
                                    the progress of students over multiple semesters, providing insights into their
                                    academic journey.

                            </section>

                            <section>
                                <h2>Steps Involved</h2>
                                <h3>1. Data Import and Cleaning</h3>
                                <p>The first step in the project is importing the dataset from an Excel sheet saved as a
                                    CSV file. Once the data is imported using <strong><i>pandas</strong></i>, the dataset is
                                    cleaned by removing unnecessary columns and rows. The first row, containing column
                                    headers, is adjusted, and invalid or missing values are replaced with zero.</p>

                                <h3>2. Data Transformation</h3>
                                <p>After cleaning, the columns of the dataset are renamed for better clarity and
                                    readability. The marks data, which could be in string format (like '-'), is
                                    transformed into numerical format (floats) to facilitate analysis and plotting.</p>

                                <h3>3. Generating the Progress Report</h3>
                                <p>For each student, a progress report is generated. This involves fetching their data
                                    based on their registration number, extracting the CGPA scores from different
                                    semesters, and plotting them on a graph. The graph is enhanced with text labels for
                                    each data point to make the progress visible at a glance. The CGPA scores for each
                                    semester are plotted against the semesters on the X-axis, and the corresponding CGPA
                                    values are plotted on the Y-axis.</p>

                                <h3>4. Saving Reports</h3>
                                <p>The generated progress reports are optionally saved as PNG files for each student.
                                    These reports are stored in a directory, with each file named after the student's
                                    registration number for easy identification.</p>

                                <h2>Code Overview</h2>
                                <p>The following Python libraries were used:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>pandas:</strong> For reading, cleaning, and transforming the dataset.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>matplotlib:</strong> For visualizing the progress report in the form of
                                        graphs.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Key Functions</h3>
                                <p>The core function of the project is
                                    <strong><i>progress_Report(reg, want_to_save_report = 0)</strong></i>, which takes a student's
                                    registration number as input and generates a visual progress report for the student.
                                    If the <strong><i>want_to_save_report</strong></i> parameter is set to 1, the report is saved
                                    as an image file.
                                </p>

                                <p>The dataset is processed in the following way:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The first row is removed as it contains the header data.</li>
                                    <li>The 'Sr.No' column is dropped as it's irrelevant to the report generation.</li>
                                    <li>Missing values (represented by '-') are replaced with 0 in the dataset.</li>
                                    <li>All numerical columns are converted to float type to ensure consistency in
                                        calculations and plotting.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>This project provides a straightforward approach to analyzing student progress and
                                    visualizing their academic journey. By generating graphical reports that reflect
                                    their CGPA progress over multiple semesters, this project helps students understand
                                    their academic performance and areas where improvement is needed. The code can be
                                    further enhanced to include additional features such as comparing the performance
                                    with class averages or generating summary reports for faculty.</p>
